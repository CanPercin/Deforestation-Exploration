There is one particularly bright spot in the data at the country level, China. This country actually increased in forest area from 1990 to 2016 by 527229.06 km2. 
It would be interesting to study what has changed in this country over this time to drive this figure in the data higher. 
The country with the next largest increase in forest area from 1990 to 2016 was the United States, but it only saw an increase of 79200 km2, much lower than the figure for China.

China and United States are of course very large countries in total land area, so when we look at the largest percent change in forest area from 1990 to 2016,
we aren’t surprised to find a much smaller country listed at the top.
